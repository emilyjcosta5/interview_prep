Tree: data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.
- directed acyclic graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges

Binary Tree: at each node, at most two children (left and right child). 

**Traversal**
Pre-order: root first, left subtree, right subtree
In-order: left subtree, root, right subtree
-gives in order for binary search tree
Post-order: left subtree, right subtree, root
-deletion process in post-order
-widely used in mathematical expression
-use a stack, every operator you meet pop 2 elements, calculate results, then pop result back to stack

**Breadth-First Search**
traverses a tree or graph
starts with a root node and visits the node itself first then goes to children then so on.
