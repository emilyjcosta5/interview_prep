Initial Phone Call w/Recruiter
-------------------------------
8/27/2019
7-7:30 p.m.
------------------------------- 
This phone call was to give me an idea of the recruitment process, how to prepare for interviews, and an expected timeline for completion of the process.
* Recruiter name: Molly Haas
* Molly initially contacted me through LinkedIn
* I should request that my internship be in the Fall 2020 semester
* Follow up with Molly every week or two
* I think every other student in the call (about four of them) was also pleasantly surprised and excited that Google is recruiting them


**Reflection**

Why do I think Google recruited me?
-----------------------------------
I believe it is because of my math background, research experience, and participation in multiple projects. I think my skillset is appealing to companies bombarded with "computer scientists" (though, I would consider myself one more so than mathematician). I honestly was in disbelief when a Google recruiter contacted me (and still am!).

Technical skills I can improve?
-------------------------------
* Hashing and mapping: I barely have an idea of what they even are. I know they are critical in doing these technical interviews, but have yet to practice the implementations of them.
* Dynamic programming: I feel decent in this. However, I want to be execptional. This can seriously make me stand out in the interviews.

Other skills I can improve?
---------------------------
* Laying out my approach to solving a programming problem: perhaps more pseudo-code and suggesting more than the first solution that comes to mind
* Reply to emails in a timely manner: this is, like, the worst

**Misc**

Ideas
-----
Create some JupyterNBs to help with interviewing in Python
* This can be a series and put on my GitHub as a public repo
* Solutions can be immediately shown by %load
* Explanations can be easily given as tutorial progresses
* Perhaps, for now, just include lots of comments in current prep code that can be later transferred to JupyterNBs
